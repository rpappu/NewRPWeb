I am CEO of [Apeiron Labs](https://www.apeironlabs.com), a venture-backed startup that is working to reduce the cost of ocean monitoring by orders of magnitude.

Until mid-2022, I was SVP and CTO at [InQTel](http://iqt.org), where I work long-term technology strategy and roadmaps, [tools to systematically understand technology innovation](https://www.iqt.org/library/organizing-deep-tech-at-scale-a-technology-architecture-approach), and diligence for deep tech investments in Quantum Information Science, AI, IoT, and 5G. I helped co-found and was a Senior Commercializaton Advisor at [IQT Emerge](https://www.iqt.org/library/iqt-announces-launch-of-iqt-emerge-nc-to-enhance-technology-commercialization-for-national-security) where I worked with DARPA-funded startups on commercialization strategies. Emerge was spun out of In-Q-Tel in early 2023.

Prior to this, I was a platform architect at [Trimble Navigation](https://www.trimble.com). I went to Trimble from [ThingMagic](http://meche.mit.edu/news-media/catching-radio-waves), a venture-backed pioneer in the RFID/IoT space that I co-founded. ThingMagic was acquired by Trimble Navigation.

As a scientist (Ph.D., MIT 2001), I have worked on [original and influential contributions](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=h8YeWokAAAAJ&hl=en) ([Physically Unclonable Functions](https://ravipappu.netlify.app/projects/powf.html), [Cryptography](https://nbviewer.org/github/rpappu/pdf-publications/blob/master/2008-044.pdf), [Haptic Holography](https://ravipappu.netlify.app/projects/holovideo.html), and [Wavelets](https://nbviewer.org/github/rpappu/pdf-publications/blob/master/GandhiRaoPappuIEEESP97.pdf)) to several fields. I am a science/technology/mathematics omnivore and really enjoy bringing my skills to bear on solving challenging problems at the intersection of science, technology, and product development. I am equally comfortable synthesizing a technology/product vision as I am executing it.

My [Erdos Number](https://oakland.edu/enp/thedata/) is 3. (Paul Erdos → Leonard Schulman → Benjamin Recht → Ravi Pappu)
