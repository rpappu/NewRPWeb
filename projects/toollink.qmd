My team, the Advanced Development Group at ThingMagic, designed and built ToolLink, by Ford and Dewalt. This was a simple RFID system that let contractors track tools using RFID. The system was sold as an option for all the Ford F-Series pickups, E-Series vans, and the Transit Connects.

This product won a [2009 Ford World Excellence Award in the New Customer-Focused Technology category](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/ford-world-excellence-awards-8040.html).
