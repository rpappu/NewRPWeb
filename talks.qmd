Despite this progress, a crucial gap remains. In this talk, I'll recount the (un)fortunate events that led me to discover PUFs and share key highlights of PUF research since. Looking back from a vantage point twenty years in the future, I'll explore some desired results required to bridge the gap and establish a theoretical framework for unclonability.",

We consider two approaches: (1) Key sharing across space, i.e., via simultaneously emitted values that may follow different data paths and (2) Key sharing across time, i.e., in temporally staggered emissions. Our constructions are of general interest, treating, for instance, the basic problem of constructing highly compact secret shares. Our main motivating problem, however, is practical key management in RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) systems. We describe the application of our techniques to RFID-enabled supply chains and a prototype privacy-enhancing system.",

    event: "Security Seminar, Cambridge University, UK",
    location: "Cambridge University, UK",
    year: 2002,
    type: "Conference Talk",
    abstract: "Modern cryptographic practice rests on the use of one-way functions, which are easy to evaluate but difficult to invert. Unfortunately, commonly used one-way functions are either based on unproven conjectures or have known vulnerabilities. We show that instead of relying on number theory, the mesoscopic physics of coherent transport through a disordered medium can be used to allocate and authenticate unique identifiers by physically reducing the medium's microstructure to a fixed-length string of binary digits. These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant. We provide an authentication protocol based on the enormous address space that is a principal characteristic of physical one-way functions.",
